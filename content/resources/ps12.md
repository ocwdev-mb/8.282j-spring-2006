description: This file contains problems based on orbiting galaxies, distance determinations,
  galaxy redshift from the Ca II K Line, measuring a quasar redshift, identifying
  the lines and determining the redshift of a quasar, a simple determination of the
  hubble law, freefall time for a cluster of galaxies and luminosity function of galaxies
  in rich clusters.
